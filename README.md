To-Do List
The application allows users to add tasks by entering text in the input field and clicking the "Add Task" button. 

The tasks are displayed in a list below the input field, where each task can be checked off to indicate completion. Completed tasks are visually represented with a strikethrough. 

Users can also delete tasks using the red trash can icon next to each task.
